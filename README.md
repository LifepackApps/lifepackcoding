# Lifepack Coding
Welcome to Lifepack Coding.  In this github repository we have some content belonging to our course.  

## Scratch projects:

### Grade 8 - Data Analysis
Credit - Initial Scratch code by WildTraces - Project https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/401556930/

This Scratch project was duplicated and adjusted to calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient, also referred to as Person's r.
You can read more about this on the wiki page located here:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient

For this grade we have an initial file DataAnalysisRelationships.sb3

Our goal is to adjust this Scratch project so that, given r, we can we can determine the linear correlation between data points, and so that we can display this correlation on the screen.

Goal:  
1.  Add the conditionals needed to evaluate the variable r (which is pre-calculated) to determine the relationship status between the datapoints.  The possibilities are:
  - None
  - Positive Weak
  - Positive Moderate
  - Positive Strong
  - Negative Weak
  - Negative Moderate
  - Negative Strong
2.  Create the costumes that will render text at the bottom of the screen that displays the relationship status
